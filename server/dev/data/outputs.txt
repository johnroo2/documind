jurisdiction to regulate trade reporting with respect to derivatives activities or to
regulate persons with respect to trade reporting in connection with their derivatives
activities (including without limitation, the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading
Commission or other U.S. regulators in the case of trade reporting under applicable
U.S. laws, and the European Securities and Markets Authority and national
regulators in the E.U. under the E.U. Regulation No. 648/2012 on OTC derivatives,

At the date of publication of this form of representation letter, the following provinces have adopted a definition of
"derivative" - Ontario (Securities Act, s.1(1)), Manitoba (Securities Act, s.1(1)) , and Québec (Derivatives Act, s.3).
The meaning of the term "derivative" under the Ontario and Manitoba Securities Acts is "an option, swap, futures
contract, forward contract or other financial or commodity contract or instrument whose market price, value, delivery
obligations, payment obligations or settlement obligations are derived from, reference to or based on an underlying
interest (including a value, price, rate, variable, index, event, probability or thing).". The meaning of derivative under
the Québec Derivatives Act is " an option, a swap, a futures contract, a contract for difference or any other contract or
instrument whose market price, value, or delivery or payment obligations are derived from, referenced to or based on
an underlying interest, or any other contract or instrument designated by regulation or considered equivalent to a
derivative on the basis of criteria determined by regulation".

TR Rules means Rule 91-507 and equivalent rules, regulations, instruments,
directives or orders when finalized by any Canadian Regulator.
Transaction means the entering into, assigning, selling or otherwise acquiring or
disposing of a Derivative or the novation of a Derivative.
Introduction
The Ontario Securities Commission (OSC), the Manitoba Securities Commission (MSC)
and the Autorité des marchés financiers (AMF), respectively, published Rule 91-507
requiring "reporting counterparties" to report certain derivatives data to "designated" or
"recognized" trade repositories2 with respect to transactions involving "local
counterparties". The OSC, MSC and AMF have also published companion policies. In
these three jurisdictions, for trades involving a "clearing agency" or a Dealer, trade
reporting begins on October 31, 2014 and, for trades that do not involve such entities, on
June 30, 2015. The securities regulatory authorities in certain of the remaining provinces of
Canada have indicated their intention to introduce substantially identical rules by way of a
multi-lateral instrument.3 Canadian federally regulated financial institutions may become
subject to similar federal or national rules, orders or directives.
It is anticipated that other rules and instruments to be published and finalized by Canadian
Regulators with respect to Derivatives will include a substantially equivalent definition of
"local counterparty" to that in the TR Rules.
This letter allows you to provide information needed to assess how Canadian Regulatory
Requirements do or may apply to Transactions between us.
Please consider each of the five parts of this letter set out below.

This information is needed because the TR Rules do (and the Other
Derivatives Rules may) apply to Transactions with you if you are not a
Canadian Person in a particular jurisdiction, but are an affiliate of a Canadian
Person with respect to that jurisdiction and that Canadian Person is
responsible generally for your liabilities. A Canadian Person may be
responsible for your liabilities if it has guaranteed all or substantially all of
your liabilities (not only your liabilities under Transactions between us). If
you are an unlimited liability company affiliated with a Canadian Person you
may have to consider whether your shareholder is responsible for your
liabilities.
(A)We Are Not an Affiliate of a Responsible Canadian Person
We hereby represent that we reasonably believe that no Canadian Person
that is our affiliate is responsible for our liabilities.
This representation shall be deemed repeated each time we enter into a
Transaction with you unless we have notified you to the contrary in a timely
manner in writing prior to entering into such Transaction.
(B) We Are An Affiliate of a Responsible Canadian Person.
We hereby represent that we reasonably believe that a Canadian Person with
respect to the jurisdiction(s) specified below, that is our affiliate, is
responsible for our liabilities.
Instructions: You may be required to select more than one jurisdiction.
If any affiliated Canadian Person responsible for your liabilities is
incorporated or organized under the federal laws of Canada or of a
province or territory, select Canada or that province or territory, as
applicable. In addition, if such person or company has its head office
and/or principal place of business in a different province or territory,
also select that jurisdiction or those jurisdictions. If there is more than
one such affiliated entity, select the relevant jurisdiction for each of
such entities.

III. Consent to Disclosure to Regulators and Trade Repositories
Instructions: By executing this letter you indicate your consent to the
disclosure of information in accordance with the Canadian Reporting
Requirements. If you select the box labelled "All Reporting
Requirements" you indicate your additional consent to disclosure in
accordance with Non-Canadian Regulatory Requirements.
For purposes of this consent, "Reporting Requirements" means any Canadian
Reporting Requirements and, if "All Reporting Requirements" is selected, it
means any Canadian Reporting Requirements and any Non-Canadian
Reporting Requirements, and "Regulator" means any Canadian Regulator and,
if "All Reporting Requirements" is selected, it means any Canadian Regulator
and any Non-Canadian Regulator.
All Reporting Requirements
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in any non-disclosure, confidentiality
or other agreement between us and any other party, we hereby consent to the
disclosure of information:
(a) to the extent required by Reporting Requirements in accordance
with which the other party is required to act; or
(b) to and between the other party's head office, branches or affiliates,
or any persons or entities who provide services to such other party or its
head office, branches or affiliates, in each case, in connection with such
Reporting Requirements.
We acknowledge that pursuant to global regulatory reform initiatives,
regulators require reporting of trade data to increase market transparency and
6216374 v3
7
--- PAGE 8 ---
enable regulators to monitor systemic risk to ensure safeguards are
implemented globally.
We further acknowledge that disclosures made pursuant hereto may include,
without limitation, the disclosure of trade information including a party's
identity (by name, address, corporate affiliation, identifier or otherwise) to any
swap or trade data repository or one or more systems or services operated by
any trade repository (TR) and any relevant Regulators, and that such
disclosures could result in certain anonymous swap transaction and pricing
data becoming available to the public. We further acknowledge that, for
purposes of complying with regulatory reporting obligations, a party may use a
third party service provider to transfer trade information into a TR and that a
TR may engage the services of a global trade repository regulated by one or
more governmental regulators. We also acknowledge that disclosures made
pursuant hereto may be made to recipients in a jurisdiction other than that of
the disclosing party or a jurisdiction that may not necessarily provide an
equivalent or adequate level of protection for personal data as our home
jurisdiction. For the avoidance of doubt, (i) to the extent that applicable non-
disclosure, confidentiality, bank secrecy, data privacy or other law imposes
non-disclosure requirements on transaction and similar information required or
permitted to be disclosed as contemplated herein but permits a party to waive
such requirements by consent, the consent and acknowledgements provided
herein shall be a consent by us for purposes of such law; (ii) any agreement
between us and another party to maintain confidentiality of information
contained in any agreement between us and the other party or in any non-
disclosure, confidentiality or other agreement shall continue to apply to the
extent that such agreement is not inconsistent with the disclosure of
information in connection with the Reporting Requirements as set out herein;
and (iii) nothing herein is intended to limit the scope of any other consent to
disclosure separately given by us to another party.
We represent and warrant that any third party to whom we owe a duty of
confidence in respect of the information disclosed has consented to the
disclosure of that information.
IV. Additional Covenant Re Reporting Responsibility
Instructions: If you are a Registered Dealer in a jurisdiction you do not have to
select that jurisdiction in answering this question as you will be a Dealer for
purposes of the Canadian Reporting Requirements in that jurisdiction by
virtue of the registration. Canadian Reporting Requirements apply to Dealers
even if they are not Registered Dealers in the jurisdiction. You may elect to
6216374 v3
8
--- PAGE 9 ---
provide this covenant if you are a Dealer in the specified jurisdictions10 or if
you are not or may not be a Dealer in the specified jurisdictions, but you are
nevertheless prepared to report the transaction data and accept the other
obligations of a reporting counterparty as if you were a Dealer in that
jurisdiction. If both you and your counterparty agree to the Reporting Party
Rules by selecting the covenant in Part V or otherwise, whether or not you will
be the reporting counterparty on the basis of this Part IV covenant will be
determined by the Reporting Party Rules.
For purposes of the Canadian Reporting Requirements of the jurisdictions specified
below, and for those purposes only, we hereby agree to report as if we were a
Dealer:
Canada

Alberta
British Columbia
Manitoba
New Brunswick
Newfoundland and Labrador
Nova Scotia
Ontario
Prince Edward Island
Québec
Saskatchewan
Yukon
Northwest Territories
Nunavut
This covenant is not a representation that we are a Dealer in any of the above
selected jurisdictions.
V. Agreements regarding Reporting Party Rules
Instructions: If you are potentially a reporting party under Canadian Reporting
Requirements, select (A) to agree to be within the Dealer category in the
Reporting Party Rules and to agree to the Reporting Party Rules.
If you do not select (A), you may select (B) to agree to the process in the
Reporting Party Rules for determining the counterparty that will report
transaction data in situations where both parties have a reporting obligation.
You will not, however, be a Dealer for purposes of the Reporting Party Rules
